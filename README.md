    Click + Shift in the Spectral tab: displays the frequency and FFT modulus at the clicked point.

    Click + Ctrl in the Spectral tab: plots a cross around the peak that is within –x dB of the clicked value.

    Click + Alt in the Spectral tab: plots the bandwidth at –x dB relative to the clicked value.

    Click + Ctrl + Shift in the Spectral tab: computes the total harmonic distortion (THD).

All numerical values are displayed in the Oscilloscope Logger window and in the Marker Values grid (you can copy and paste these values into your favorite spreadsheet).

You can adjust the spacing between peaks in the Parameters tab (interface window) using the slider.

You can change the band-pass level in the Parameters tab (interface window) using the Bandwidth slider.
